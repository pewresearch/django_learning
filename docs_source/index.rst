Django Learning
*************************************

Django Learning is a content analysis and machine learning framework designed to make it easy to
develop a codebook, validate it, collect training data with crowdsourcing, and apply it at scale
with machine learning.  At the moment, you won't find bleeding edge deep learning here; instead,
this library is intended to provide a rigorous and reliable framework for developing ML models with
tried-and-true methods and validating them to ensure that they achieve performance comparable to humans.
