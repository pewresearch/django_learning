# Django Learning

Django Learning is a content analysis and machine learning framework designed to make it easy to develop a codebook, 
validate it, collect training data with crowdsourcing, and apply it at scale with machine learning. At the moment, you 
won’t find bleeding edge deep learning here; instead, this library is intended to provide a rigorous and reliable 
framework for developing ML models with tried-and-true methods and validating them to ensure that they achieve 
performance comparable to humans.

## Installation

To install, you can use `pip`:

    pip install django_learning

Or you can install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/pewresearch/django_learning.git
    cd django_learning
    pip install -e .

### Installation Troubleshooting

#### Using 64-bit Python

Some of our libraries require the use of 64-bit Python. If you encounter errors during installation \
that are related to missing libraries, you may be using 32-bit Python. We recommend that you uninstall \
this version and switch to a 64-bit version instead. On Windows, these will be marked with `x86-64`; you \
can find the latest 64-bit versions of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

#### Installing ssdeep

ssdeep is an optional dependency that can be used by the `get_hash` function in Pewtils. \
Installation instructions for various Linux distributions can be found in the library's \
[documentation](https://python-ssdeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). The ssdeep \
Python library is not currently compatible with Windows. \
Installing ssdeep on Mac OS may involve a few additional steps, detailed below:

1. Install Homebrew
2. Install xcode
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```
3. Install system dependencies
    ```
    brew install pkg-config libffi libtool automake
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/glibtoolize /usr/local/bin/libtoolize
    ```
4. Install ssdeep with an additional flag to build the required libraries
    ```
    BUILD_LIB=1 pip install ssdeep
    ```
5. If step 4 fails, you may need to redirect your system to the new libraries by setting the following flags:
    ```
    export LIBTOOL=`which glibtool`
    export LIBTOOLIZE=`which glibtoolize`
    ```
   Do this and try step 4 again.
6. Now you should be able to run the main installation process detailed above.
